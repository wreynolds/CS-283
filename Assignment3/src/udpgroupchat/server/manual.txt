After receiving a message, the user must do an ACK, if the server does not receive an ACK within 3s it resends the message. If reconnecting to the server, or if the client IP Address changes, the user must do an UPDATE_IP. After doing a PULL (or and UPDATE_IP which automatically does a PULL) wait for END OF MESSAGES to appear before acknowledgement, if END OF MESSAGES does not appear or there are missing numbers in the sequence of messages (~3s wait) do another PULL.  Any user may add any other user to a group. Users may remove only themselves from a group. LIST_GROUPS displays all the groups and idicates if the user is in the group (+ signifies memeber, - signifies not a member). Anyone connected to the server can list all the registered users.
