After receiving a message, the user must do an ACKNOWLEDGE. If reconnecting to the server, or if the client IP Address changes, the user must do an UPDATE_IP. After doing a PULL (or and UPDATE_IP which automatically does a PULL) wait for END OF MESSAGES to appear before acknowledgement, if message does not appear (~3s wait) do another PULL.  Any user may add any other user to a group. Users may remove only themselves from a group. LIST_GROUPS displays all the groups and idicates if the user is in the group (+ signifies memeber, - signifies not a member). Anyone connected to the server can list all the registered users.
